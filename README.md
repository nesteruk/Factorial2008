Factorial2008
=============
This little program solves the following problem:

Given thirteen zeros and trivial mathematical operations, produce a result of 2008.

Of course, the key to this solution is to turn zeros to non-zero via the operation 0! = 1 (factorial). Thus, you end up with thirteen 1s, but what to do with them?

We can continue using factorials to arrive at larger values, but none of them are convenient enough to yield 2008. Can some combination of these values help? This is what the program attempts to determine.

Discussion of this problem was published on Hexlet but is regrettably no longer accessible.
